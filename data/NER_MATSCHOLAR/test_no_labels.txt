the

have
large

In

were
found
through

we

to

it

the

both

the

.


with

,
the

mainly
depended
on

while
the

was
a

was
discovered
on

and
the

of
O2Zr
and

.


the
O2Zr

were
prepared
by

with
mixed

of
O
and
Ar
at

followed
by

.


the

were
grown
at

.


the

was
formed
with
both
Zr
silicide
and
Zr

at
the
interface
between

during
the
post-annealing
process
due
to
rapid

through
the

.


after

,
the

of

A

(

)
with
a
water

angle
of
<nUm>

and
a

fabricated
on

by
immersing
the

perpendicularly
into

and
followed
by

.


the

.


the

was
characterized
via

.


the

the

can
be

enhanced

from
graphene-TiO2

the
graphene-TiO2

-
like
carbon
(

)
nanocomposite
films
were
prepared
on
silicon
substrates
by

process
using
N
,
n-dimethylformamide
(
DMF
)
as
carbon
source
and
O2Ti
nanoparticles
/

sheets
as
incorporated
reagents
.


the
results
show
that
the
O2Ti
and
graphene
sheets
are
uniformly
dispersed
into
the
DLC
matrix
.


the
UV
-
light
illumination
not
only
affects
the
morphology
of
the
films
,
but
also
promotes
the
field
emission
properties
,
probably
due
to
the
effect
of
photoinduced
electron
-
hole
pairs
produced
from
O2Ti
.


the
G-TiO2
/

film
exhibits
the

and
the
highest

at
the

.


this
enhancement
of

properties
are
investigated
based
on
the
surface

of
the
self

,
the

,
together
with
the

of
AlFe

mild

was
coated
by
hot

dipping
in
a
molten
aluminum
bath
.


the
Fe

Al

Nb
alloyed
coating
was
prepared
by
implanting
the
Nb
atoms
into
the
Fe
–
Al
coating
using
a
double

glow
plasma
surface
metallurgy
method
.


the
morphology
,
element
distribution
and
phase
composition
of
the
alloyed
layer
were
characterized
by
OM
,
SEM
/
EDX
and
XRD
.


meanwhile
,
the
basic
mechanical
properties
of
these
two
coatings
were
measured
and
compared
.


the
results
showed
that
the
Nb
element
exhibited
gradient
distribution
in
the
Fe
–
Al
coating
.


and
the
alloyed
layer
consisted
of
pure
Nb
,
Al5Fe2
,
AlFe3
,
AlNb2
and
Fe7Nb6
phases
.


after
Nb
addition
,
the
microhardness
of
the
Fe
–
Al
coating
was
improved
for
the
diffusely
distributed
carbide
phases
.


and
the
adhesion
was
enhanced
with
better
plastic
deformation
.


what
's
more
,
the
nanoindentation
tests
indicated
that
the
toughness
of
the
Fe

Al
coating
was
improved
with
a
stronger
ability
to
resist
plastic
deformation
and
a
greater

.


effects
of

on
the

improved
toughness
is
one
of
the
central
goals
in
the
development
of
wear
-

coatings
.


previous
studies
of
toughness
in
transition
metal

alloys
have
addressed
the
effects
of
chemical
composition
in
these

.


herein
,
we
use
density

to
study
the
effects
of
various
metal

,
ranging
from
fully

,
on
the
mechanical

of
VM2N
and

(

.


results
show
that
all

disordered

arrangements
yield
lower
values
of

and
C11
elastic
constants
,
as
well
as
higher
values
of
C44
elastic
constants
,
compared
to
ordered
structures
.


we
attribute
the
low
C44
values
of
ordered
structures
to
the
formation
of
fully
-
bonding
states
perpendicular
to
the
applied
stress
.


we
find
that
the
ductility
of
these
compounds
is
primarily
an
effect
of
the
increased
valence
electron
concentration
induced
upon

.

,

of
a

,
and

of

.


although
each

is
well

,
an

of

.


to
the
best
of
our
knowledge
,
this
is
the
highest
photocurrent

obtained
using
a

photoanode
,
and
such
long

has
been

.


the

are
thoroughly
characterized
using
various
spectroscopic
and
electrochemical

.


while
the

,
the

for

prepared
by
low

and
their

OZn

were
also
prepared
by

methods
,
and
their
properties
and
photocatalytic

were
compared
to
that
of
bare
OZn
nanorods
.


we
found
that
OZn
and
O2Ti
exhibited
comparable
photocatalytic
performance
.


faster
dye
degradation
under
simulated
solar
illumination
was
observed
for
OZn
,
while
under
UV
illumination
faster
degradation
was
observed
for
O2Ti
.


OZn
nanorods
with
titania
shells
exhibited
inferior
photocatalytic
performance
,
while
for
alumina
shells
the
performance
was
similar
to
bare
OZn
.


reasons
for
observed
differences
are
discussed
,
and
the
effect
of
the
shell
on
photocatalytic
activity
is
attributed
to
the
changes
in
native

at
the
OZn

the

the

was
deduced
from

from

As
determined
from

,
the
contribution
of

is
very
low

consisted
of

the

shows
a

,
which
we
show
is
a

.


the

indicates
that
the
dominant

comes
from

revealed
that

exhibited
lower

effect

fabricated
by
introducing
Zn
and
Y
elements
into
Mg
–
<nUm>
%
Zr
alloys
under

solidification
condition
.


due
to
the
coherent
lattice
relationship
between
the
I-Mg3YZn6
phase
and
the
a-Mg
matrix
,
the
grain
sizes
of
the
Mg

Zn

Y
–
Zr
alloys
are
obviously
refined
and
the
tensile
strengths
are
largely
improved
to
a
maximum
value
of
<nUm>
MPa
.


the
fracture
mechanism
transformed
from
cleavage
fracture
to
quasi-cleavage
fracture
with
increasing
amount
of
I-Mg3YZn6
phase
.


the
damping
capacities
of
the
Mg

Zn
–
Y
–
Zr
alloys
decrease
with
the
increasing
I-Mg3YZn6
phase
and
the
damping
behavior
can
be
explained
with
the
g

L
dislocation
model
.


the
forming
of
the
I-Mg3YZn6
phase
makes
more
grain
boundaries
,
phases

interfaces
generate
in
the
alloys
.


and
the
dislocation
densities
in
the
alloys
hardly
changes
as
little
residual
stress
or
entanglement
of
dislocation
generates
at
the
interface
between
the
I-Mg3YZn6
phase
and
the

so
the
damping
values
are
reduced
accordingly
with
the

on

increasing
tremendously

the

the
abrasion
wear
resistance
of
the
AlNTi
coatings
was
measured
by
a
micro-abrasion
tester
with
the
presence
of
CSi
water
-
based
slurry
with
a
concentration
of
<nUm>
g
/
cm3
.


it
was
found
that
with
increasing
the
Al
/
Ti
atomic
ratio
the
hardness
of
the
as-deposited
AlNTi
coatings
initially
increased
up
to
a
maximum
value
of
about
<nUm>
GPa
at
around
Al
/
Ti
=
<nUm>
,
and
then
the
coating
hardness
decreased
rapidly
with
increasing
aluminium
content
further
.


the
abrasion
wear
resistance
of
the
AlNTi
coatings
is
evidently
better
,
with
one
order
of
magnitude
lower
in
the
wear
rate
,
than
the
bare
HSS
substrate
.


with
increasing
Al
/
Ti
atomic
ratio
,
the
variation
trend
of
the
abrasion
wear
rate
of
the
AlNTi
coatings
is
generally
opposite
to
that
of
coating
hardness
.


this
means
the
abrasion
wear
resistance
of
the
AlNTi
PVD
hard
coatings
is
predominately
determined
by
the
hardness
of
the
coating
materials
.


it
was
also
noted
that
,
besides
the
coating
hardness
,
the
composition
of
the
AlNTi
coatings
also
plays
an
important
role
in
determining
their
abrasive
wear
resistance
.


the
coatings
in
the
higher
Al
content
range
(
Al
/
Ti
≥
<nUm>
)
exhibited
an
evident
better
abrasive
wear
resistance
than
those
in
the
lower
aluminium
content
range
(
Al
/
Ti
≤
<nUm>
)
when
their
hardness
is
similar
.


this
fact
could
be
related
to
the
finer
microstructure
of
the
coatings
incorporated
with
higher
aluminium
content
.

to
this
end

we
herein
report
a

consisting
of
approximately
<nUm>
%
Fe3O4
nanorods
and
<nUm>
%

(

microscopy

have
identified
that
the
Fe3O4
nanorods
are
wrapped
(
or
encapsulated
)
by
the
rGO
nanosheets
via
covalent
bonding
,
which
further
self
-
assemble
into
a
mesoporous
hybrid
composite
networked
by
the

the
composite
has
an
average

around
<nUm>
nm
and
exhibits
a
high
surface
area
of
<nUm>
m2
g-1
,
which
is
<nUm>
times
as
high
as
that
of

we
have
used
the
composite
as
an
LIB
anode
material
to
fabricate
coin

cells
with
lithium
as
the

systematic
half

show
that
the
electrochemical
performance
of
the
present
composite
material
is
amongst
the
best
of
the

the

overall
,
we
have
demonstrated
that

is
an

delamination
-
resistant
bi-layer
electrolyte
for
anode
-
supported
solid
oxide
fuel
cells


one
of
the
critical
fuel
cell
degradation
phenomena
is
‘
cell
imbalance
’
in
a
series
-
connected
stack
,
which
can
cause
abnormal
operation
under
a
negative
cell
voltage
and
consequently
rapid
degradation
by
anode
interface
delamination
.


In
a
previous
study
,
the
effect
of
electrolyte
composition
on
the
electrochemical
degradation
of
solid
oxide
fuel
cell
(
SOFC
)
was
investigated
,
and
it
was
observed
that
a
small
amount
of
ceria
(
an
electronic
conducting
material
)
prevents
anode
delamination
under
abnormal
(
negative
voltage
)
operation
.


however
,
the
open
circuit
voltage
(
OCV
)
was
lowered
as
a
result
of
reduction
of
ceria
.


In
the
present
study
,
bi-layer
,
YSZ
(
<nUm>
mol
%
yttria
doped
zirconia
,
a
predominantly
ionic
conductor
)
at
the
cathode
side
and
8CYSZ
(
<nUm>
mol
%
ceria
doped
YSZ
,
a
mixed
ionic
-
electronic
conductor
)
at
the
anode
side
were
fabricated
for
anode
-
supported
cells
with
a
Pt
probe
embedded
in
each
layer
to
estimate
the
internal
oxygen
chemical
potential
and
tested
under
a
negative
voltage
.


the
results
indicated
that
the
OCV
was
close
to
the
theoretical
value
(
similar
to
that
of
a
YSZ
single
layer
cell
)
and
no
delamination
was
observed
under
negative
voltage
operation
(
similar
to
the
case
of
an
8CYSZ
single
-
layer
cell
)
.


therefore
,
the
bi-layer-structured
electrolyte
(
with
locally
increased
electronic
conduction
at
the
anode
side
)
is
effective
in
preventing
anode
/
electrolyte
delamination
as
well
as
maintaining
open
circuit
voltage
.


improving
the
uniformity
in
mechanical
properties
of
a
sintered
Ti
compact
using
a
trace
amount
of
internal
lubricant


large
sintered
powder
compacts
are
likely
to
be
associated
with
variability
in
mechanical
properties
;
an
improvement
of
the
uniformity
of
the
mechanical
properties
of
sintered
powder
compacts
is
important
for
powder
metallurgy
.


In
this

Ti
powder

with
height
to

(
H

)
ratio
of
unity
to
give
a
more
uniform
green
density
.


tensile
test
pieces
were
cut
from
selected
positions
in
each
sintered
compact
to
obtain
the
distribution
of
mechanical
properties
.


results
revealed
that
variations
in
mechanical
properties
are
due
to
the
pore
morphology
with
respect
to
size
,
aspect
ratio
and
preferred
orientation
.


A
trace
amount
of
lubricant
significantly
improves
the
uniformity
in
mechanical
properties
by
optimizing
the
porosity
distribution
and
minimizing
the
pore
size
and
aspect
ratio
of
pores
after
sintering
.


such
an
effect
was
achieved
by
reducing
the
initial
green
density
inhomogeneity
and
the
stress
induced
by
the
mismatch
of
sintering
shrinkage
.


however

not
recommended
since
it
significantly
increases
the
oxygen
content
.


an
addition
of
0.6wt.
%
SA
is
the
best
choice
due
to
the
even

,
small

.

A
comprehensive
study
on
the
effect
of
various
substitutions
of
m
on
the
magnetic
and
structural

of
melt

spun
nanocomposite
Pr8Fe84M2B6
(

magnets
has
been
performed
with
the
aim
of
refining
the
microstructure
and
therefore
enhancing
the
hard
magnetic
properties
.


it
has
been
found
that
magnetic
properties
are
improved
by
all
the
substitutions
.


the
largest
enhancement
is
obtained
in
Nb
substituted
B3Fe42NbPr4
magnets
where
a
coercivity
of
<nUm>
kOe
and
a
maximum
energy
product
of
<nUm>
MGOe
have
been
obtained
,
as
compared
to
the
coercivity
of
<nUm>
kOe
and
the
energy
product
of
<nUm>
MGOe
in
the
B3Fe43Pr4
magnet
.


microstructure

revealed
a
finer
and
more
uniform
<nUm>
:
<nUm>

a-Fe
nanoscale
microstructure
with

substitutions
.


the
most
uniform
microstructure
with
the
smallest
average
grain
size
of
<nUm>
–
<nUm>
nm
is
developed
in
the
Nb
substituted
magnets
.


the
enhancement
of
magnetic
properties
by
m
substitution
is
believed
to
be
due
to
the
microstructure
refinement
which
leads
to
an
enhanced
exchange
coupling
between
BFe14Pr2
and
a-Fe
.

the

.


it
is
found
that
the

favors
the

state
and
high

ferromagnetism
can
be
expected
in
it
.


the
ferromagnetism
can
be
attributed
to
the
p-d
hybridization
between
Cd
and
its
surrounded
oxygen
atoms
.


Cd
atoms
do
not
tend
to
form
clusters
in

the

condition
.


moreover
,
Ti
vacancies
are
much
easier
to
form
than
oxygen
vacancies
in
the
doped
system
.


we
find
that
oxygen
vacancies
are
harmful
to
the
ferromagnetism
of
the
doped
system
while
Ti
vacancies
are
beneficial
to
the
stability
of
ferromagnetism
.

we

on
the
mechanical

the

by

respectively
.


furthermore
,
FTIR
spectroscopy
was
used
to
measure
the

in

.


the
amount
of
argon

,
as
well
as
the
H2Si

HSi
ratio
,
is
highly
dependent
on
the

of
the

.


all
three
parameters
decrease
with
increasing
total
gas
pressures
and
r.f.
frequencies
.


these
reductions
are
attributed
to
a
decrease
in
the
number
of
energetic

which
reach
the
growing

as
a
result
of

in

the
fact
the

not

to
the

the

of

depends
on

during

during

illustrated
that

of

,
but
the

under

with

the

is
also
increased
.


furthermore
,
the
change
of

shows
the

In

diodes
have
been
fabricated
by
a
facile
and
inexpensive
method
for
possible
use
in
solar

.


O2Ti
nanoporous
films
were
prepared
through
anodization
of
Ti
foil
and
Cu2O
films
were
deposited
on
it
to
make
the
diode
through
electrodeposition
.


the
structural
and
morphological
characterization
was
studied
by
x-ray
diffraction
(
XRD
)
and
scanning
electron
microscope
(
SEM
)
.


In
electrical
characterization
the
current

(
I
–
V
)
and
capacitance

voltage
(
C
–
V
)
characteristics
of
the
diodes
were
measured
at
room
temperature
.


the
linear
behavior
of
C
–
V
curve
indicated
that
the
carrier
concentration
was
homogeneous
in
the
film
region
adjacent
to
the

region
.

and
built
in

V
was
estimated
from

graph
.


the
transport
mechanism
was
due
to
the
poole

effect
because
the
experimentally
obtained

of

was
close
to
the
theoretical
value
calculated
for

the
values
of

microstructural
evolution
and
tensile
properties
of
Sn

5Sb
solder
alloy
containing
small
amount
of
Ag
and
Cu


the
near
peritectic
Sn
–
5Sb
Pb
-
free
solder
alloy
has
received
considerable
attention
for
high
temperature
electronic
applications
,
especially
on

.


In
the
present
study
,
a
separate
addition
of
the
same
amount
of
Ag
and
Cu
are
added
with
the
near
-
peritectic
Sn
–
5Sb
solder
alloy
to
investigate
the
effect
of
a
third
element
addition
on
the
microstructural
,
thermal
and
mechanical
properties
of
the
newly
developed
ternary
solder
alloys
.


the
results
indicate
that
the
melting
point
of
Sn
–
5Sb
solder
is
enhanced
by
Ag
and
Cu
additions
.


besides
,
the
Ag
and
Cu
content
refine
the
microstructure
and
form
new
intermetallic
compounds
(
IMCs
)
with
the
near
-
peritectic
Sn
–
5Sb
solder
alloy
.


the
tensile
tests
revealed
that
all
alloys
exhibit
higher
mechanical
strength
with
increasing
strain
rate
and
/
or
decreasing
testing
temperature
,
suggesting
that
the
tensile
behavior
of
the
three
alloys
is
strain
rate
and
temperature
dependence
.


the
yield
and
ultimate
tensile
strength
are
higher
for
Sn
–
5Sb
–
0.7Cu
alloy
compared
with
Sn
–
5Sb
and
Sn
–
5Sb
–
0.7Ag
alloys
.


good
mechanical
performance
of
Sn
–
5Sb
–
0.7Cu
solder
is
often
correlated
to
a
fine
b-Sn
grain
size
and
more
dispersed
Cu-Sn
IMC
particles
,
which
makes
the
solder
exhibit
high
strength
and

hybridizing

appropriate
for
the

of

herein
,
a
AlNi

(

)
is
vertically
grown
on
a
RGO
by
the
microwave
-

method

the

(

)
by

process
.


furthermore
,
doping
Al2O3
can
prevent
active
materials
from
agglomeration
and
generate
porous
structure
in
etching
process
.


when
used
as
anode
materials
for
LIBs
,
the
nanocomposite
exhibits
a
high
reversible
capacity
after
<nUm>
charge

cycles
at
a
current
density
of

.


even
at
500mAg-1
,
a
stable
capacity
as
high
as
<nUm>
mAhg-1
could
be
obtained
.


the
enhanced
lithium
storage
performance
is
mainly
ascribed
to
the
presence
of
the
conductive
RGO
and
Al2O3
buffer
phase
,
which
can
relieve
structural
collapse
and
offer
high
conductivity
.

we
have
carried
out
a
comprehensive
experimental
study
of
the
Si(001)
c(4

by

were
kept
under

vacuum
(

)
at

<nUm>

until
the
c(4

appeared
.

is
strongly
influenced
by
electronic
effects
and
changes
considerably
over
a
range
of

voltages
.


the
c(4

surface
reconstruction
is
a
result
of
stress
which
is
caused
by
incorporation
of
impurities
or
adsorbates
in
sub-surface

.


the
resulting
c(4

in
the
top

is
a
pure
silicon

the

At

the
contrast
is
similar
to
Si

on
the
(

.


therefore
,
besides
the
1-DV
and
the

,
another

may

this
is
a

additional
polymorphism

in

A
phase
forming
from

type
AgF
on
decrease
of
pressure
found
recently
by
vaidya
and
kennedy
has
been
studied
by
in

.


it
is
indexed
as
hexagonal
with
c
=
<nUm>
±
<nUm>
Å
and
a
=
<nUm>
±
<nUm>
Å
,
z
=
<nUm>
.


this
structure
is
probably
inverse
AsNi
.


its
pressure
of
formation
is
highly
dependent
on
the
samples
history
of
pressure
variation
.


all
three
phases
,
B1
,
B2
and
hexagonal
have
been
made
to
give
x-ray
patterns
with
each
line
split
into
two
lines
of
equal
intensity
.


we
interpret
this
as
a
decomposition
into
two
non-stoichiometric
phases
,
one
Ag
rich
and
the
other
F
rich
.


the
conditions
for
the
formation
of
these
split
phases
are
not
always
reproducible
which
suggests
that
this
is
a
metastable
phenomenon
possibly
due
to
pressure
gradients
on
the
sample
.


the
splitting
could
,
however
,
also
be
explained
by
equilibrium
behavior
.


investigation

mol

measurements
of

have
been
obtained
from

investigations
using
a

,
as
well
as
calculations
of
the
vibrational
density
-
of

(
vDOS
)
using
density
-
functional
theory
.


the
present
measurements
agree
closely
with
,
and
extend
,
previously
published
results
.


the
phonons
become
broader
and
decrease
in
intensity
as
the
brillouin
zone
boundary
is
approached
,
particularly
in
the
γ
–
δ
–
x
direction
.


interestingly
,
there
is
evidence
of
a
previously
unreported
low
energy
phonon
band
(
<nUm>
–
<nUm>
meV
)
in
the
γ
–
σ
–
x
direction
,
which
could
possibly
be
related
to
the
stabilization
(
by
yttria
doping
)
of
the
imaginary
mode
of
cubic
O2Zr
about
the
x-point
.


compared
to
pure
cubic
O2Zr
,
the
vDOS
of
YSZ
are
broader
and
extend
to
higher
frequency
.


furthermore
,
the
prominent
Zr
-
related
feature
in
the
vDOS
of
c-ZrO2
at
≈
14meV
is
shifted
to
higher
energy
in
the
vDOS
of
YSZ
.


this
behavior
is
consistent
with
the
measured
dispersion
bands
(
first
acoustic
branch
in
the
γ
–
x
direction
,
about
the
x-point
)
of
YSZ
which
is
higher
in
energy
by
a
similar
amount
relative
to
that
of
c-ZrO2
,
thus
providing
support
for
the
structural
model
considered
.

in
a

containing
80vol

water
and
20vol

of

(

.


In
contrast
,
HWZ

were
formed
in

.


also
,
cubic
zinc

(
CZB

SZn

were
formed
in

synthesized

.


the
absorption
peak
for
the
HWZ
nanorods
and
CZB
SZn
nanoparticles
was
at
wavelength
of
<nUm>
nm
and
<nUm>
nm
,
respectively
,
indicating
that
the
band
gap
energy
of
the
former
is
larger
than
that
of
the
latter
.


moreover
,
the
HWZ
SZn
exhibited
two
emission
peaks
at
<nUm>
nm
and
<nUm>
nm
.


the
peak
at
<nUm>
nm
is
attributed
to
Zn
vacancies
but
the
origin
of
the
peak
at
<nUm>
nm
remains
undetermined
.


since
the
intensity
of
the
emission
peak
at
<nUm>
nm
was
significantly
higher
for
the
HWZ
nanoparticles
than
for
nanorods
,
this
peak
might
be
associated
with
defects
in
the
HWZ
SZn
nanoparticles
.

silicon
carbide
formation
with
pulsed
laser
and
electron
beams


poly-crystalline
silicon
carbide
layers
were
obtained
through
nanosecond
pulse
heating
of
thin
carbon
films
deposited
on
silicon
wafers
.


the
samples
were
submitted
to
electron
beam
pulses
(
<nUm>
kev
,
<nUm>
ns
)
at
various
current
densities
in
vacuum
(
~
<nUm>
−
<nUm>
mbar
)
and
to
ClXe
excimer
laser
pulses
(
<nUm>
nm
,
<nUm>
ns
)
in
air
.


rutherford
backscattering
spectrometry
(
RBS
)
evidenced
that
in
the
electron
beam
annealed
samples
mixing
of
elements
at
the
C
Si
interface
starts
at
current
densities
of
about
<nUm>
A
/

.


the
mixed
layer
thickness
increases
almost
linearly
with
current
density
.


from
the
RBS
spectra
a
composition
of
the
intermixed
layers
close
to
the
CSi
compound
was
deduced
.


transmission

(

studies
clearly
evidenced
the
formation
of
CSi
poly-crystals
.


using
the
ClXe
laser
,
intermixing
of
the
deposited
C
film
with
the
Si
substrate
was
observed
after
a
single
<nUm>

.


further

evidenced
the
formation
of

properties
of
B2Mg
bulks
after
combined
doping
with
Fe
and
C
by
adding
Iron(II)
lactate
(
C6FeH10O6
)


bulk
B2Mg
doped
with
C
and
Fe
was
prepared
by
using
the
solid
state
sintering
method
with
C6FeH10O6
as
dopant
.


the

,
and

were
studied
.


x-ray
diffraction
(
XRD
)
shows
the
presence
of
iron
after
the
doping
.


the
addition
of
C6FeH10O6
increases
the
a-
and
c-axis
parameters
of
B2Mg
,
as
evidenced
by
the
shifting
of
the
(
<nUm>
)
and
(
<nUm>
)
peaks
to
a
lower
angle
on
the
XRD
patterns
.


Fe
atoms
were
distributed
uniformly
,
as
shown
by
the
field
emission
scanning
electron
microscope
images
,
while
the
magnetization
of
the
sample
was
dominated
by
the
signals
from
the
B2Mg
superconductor
,
although
the
iron
-
containing
materials
also
contributed
a
minor
amount
of
magnetization
.


the
residual
resistivity
ratio
was
decreased
as
the
C6FeH10O6
doping
level
increased
.


the
critical
temperature
also
decreased
with
increased
doping
level
,
as
did
the
critical
current
density
,
jc
.


the
doping
also
caused
decreases
in
the
irreversibility
field
,
hirr
,
and
the
upper
critical
field
,
hc2
.


the
decrease
in
hc2
and
hirr
,
together
with
the
harmful
effects
from
impurity
phases
such
as
MgO
is
the
reason
for
the
decrease
in
jc
.


optical

of

films
grown
on

by
pulsed

technique


CdSxSe1-xalloys
have
been
deposited
on
quartz
substrates
by
means
of
pulsed
laser
ablation
,
a
relatively
new
technique
for
growing
semiconductor
films
.


we
obtained
high
quality
polycrystalline
films
which
present
photoluminescence
efficiency
up
to
at
room
temperature
.


the
dependence
of
the
band
gap
on
the
x
composition
,
measured
by
absorption
spectra
at
<nUm>
K
,
shows
an
upwards
band
gap
bowing
.


the
real
part
of
the
refractive
index
in
the
transparent
region
at
room
temperature
is
well
described
by
the
sellmeier
relation
.


optical
effects
of
NiOx
interlayer
for
OLEDs
with
AZO
embedded
anodes


insertion
of
a
nickel
oxide
(
NiOx
)
in
an
aluminum
zinc
oxide
(
AZO
)
embedded
organic
light
-
emitting
diode
(
OLED
)
has
successfully
obtained
additional
<nUm>
%
light
extraction
and
led
to
an
enhanced
current
efficiency
up
to
<nUm>
%
.


the
introduced
NiOx
has
a
high
reflective
index
of
∼
<nUm>
which
allows
more
emitted
light
to
travel
through
AZO
/
ITO
interfaces
.


the
AZO
/
ITO
interfaces
provide
deflection
and
scattering
effect
to
redirect
light
away
from
being
totally
reflected
in
the
reflective-index-mismatched
OLED
structures
and
thus
are
able
to
enhance
external
light
out
-
coupling
.


results
also
showed
that
the
coating
of
NiOx
layer
increased
the
electrical
resistance
of
AZO
embedded
ITO
film
which
limited
the
current
efficiency
,
and
the
introduced
NiOx
showed
no
benefit
on
carrier
injection
as
expected
.

thin

of

oxides
of

)
,
yttrium
(
Y
)
and
titanium
(

)
were
obtained
by
the

techniques
.


zirconium

,
titanium
isopropoxide
and
yttrium
nitrate
hexahydrate
reagents
were
used
as
precursors
in
the
sol

process
.


the
Zr
/
Ti
and
Zr
/
Y
molar
ratios
have
been
controlled
by
varying
the
precursors
and

concentration
.


the
obtained

were
supported
by
dip
coating
on
a-alumina
supports
,
dried
at
<nUm>
K
and
calcinated
at
<nUm>
K
.


the
powders
obtained
after
the
removal
of
carbon
residuals
were
subsequently
pressed
and
calcinated
for
using
as
targets
for
the
magnetron

and
pulsed

techniques
.


the
chemical
composition
was
determined
by
auger
electron

.


the
surface
topography
was
investigated
by
atomic

microscopy
,
while
the

was
evaluated
from

.


the

of

is
discussed
according

enhanced
effective
mass
in
doped
O3SrTi
and
related
perovskites


the
effective
mass
is
one
of
the
main
factors
determining
the
seebeck
coefficient
and
electrical
conductivity
of
thermo
-
electrics
.


In
this
ab
-
initio
LDA
-
GGA
study
the
effective
mass
is
estimated
from
the
curvature
of
electronic
bands
by
one-band-approximation
and
is
in
excellent
agreement
with
experimental
data
of
nb-
and
La
-
doped
O3SrTi
.


it
is
clarified
that
the
deformation
of
O3SrTi
crystals
has
a
significant
influence
on
the
bandgap
,
effective
electronic
DOS
-
mass
and
band
-
mass
,
but
the
electronic
effect
due
to
the
eg
-
band
flattening
near
the
g-point
due
to
Nb
-
doping
up
to
0.2at
%
is
the
main
factor
for
the
effective
mass
increase
.


doping
of
La
shows
a
linear
decrease
of
the
effective
mass
;
this
can
be
explained
by
the
different
surroundings
of
A-
and
b-sites
in
perovskite
.


substitution
with
other
elements
such
as
Ba
on
the
a-site
and
V
on
the
b-site
in
O3SrTi
increases
the
effective
mass
as
well
.


A
study
of
defects
in
deformed
FeSi
alloys
using
positron
annihilation
techniques


steels
with
high
amounts
of
silicon
are
used
in
electrical
applications
due
to
their
low
magnetostriction
,
high
electrical
resistivity
and
reduced
energy
losses
,
but
they
exhibit
poor
formability
.


the
slow
positron
beam
of
gent
is
used
to
investigate
defects
in
different
deformed
FeSi
alloys
.


it
was
found
that
the
concentration
of
defects
for
the
alloys
deformed
at
high
temperatures
are
different
from
the
ones
related
to
the
alloys
deformed
at
room
temperature
.


these
results
are
correlated
to
the
results
of
positron
annihilation
lifetime
spectroscopy
(
PALS
)
.
